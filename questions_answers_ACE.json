When you add a GPU node\n  pool to an existing cluster that already runs a non-GPU node pool, GKE automatically taints the GPU nodes\n  with the following node taint: Key: nvidia.com/gpu Effect: NoSchedule Note: If a GPU node pool is added to a\n  cluster where all the existing node pools are GPU node pools, or if you are creating a new cluster with a GPU\n  attached default pool, the above taint will not be added to the GPU nodes. The taint will also not be added to\n  the existing GPU nodes retrospectively when a non-GPU node pool is added afterwards. Additionally, GKE\n  automatically applies the corresponding tolerations to Pods requesting GPUs by running the\n  ExtendedResourceToleration admission controller. This causes only Pods requesting GPUs to be scheduled on\n  GPU nodes, which enables more efficient autoscaling: your GPU nodes can quickly scale down if there are not\n  enough Pods requesting GPUs",

        "explanation": "Best practices\n\n  In general, Google recommends that each instance that needs to call a Google API should run as a service\n\f  account with the minimum permissions necessary for that instance to do its job. In practice, this means you\n  should configure service accounts for your instances with the following process: Create a new service\n  account rather than using the Compute Engine default service account. Grant IAM roles to that service\n  account for only the resources that it needs. Configure the instance to run as that service account. Grant the\n  instance the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform scope to allow full access to all Google Cloud\n  APIs, so that the IAM permissions of the instance are completely determined by the IAM roles of the service\n  account. Avoid granting more access than necessary and regularly check your service account permissions to\n  make sure they are up-to-date.\n\n  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-\n  instances#best_practices\n\n  Reference:\n\n  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances",

        "question": "You are working for a startup that was officially registered as a business 6 months ago. As your customer base grows, your use of Google Cloud increases.

By creating a billing account and associating a\n  payment method with it, you establish a central source for billing and payment for all projects.Granting\n  project creators permission to associate the billing account with their projects ensures that they can create\n  projects without the need for their individual credit card information. This approach streamlines the process\n  and avoids the hassle of collecting credit card details from each engineer.Additionally, this option allows for\n  easy monitoring and management of project costs through a single billing account, making it simpler to track\n  expenses and allocate resources effectively.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "I was split between A and D for a moment, but after reviewing this, I think that it is D.\n\n  As to mexblood1's point, CPU utilization is a recommended proxy for traffic when it comes to Cloud Spanner.\n  See: Alerts for high CPU utilization The following table specifies our recommendations for maximum CPU\n  usage for both single-region and multi-region instances. These numbers are to ensure that your instance has\n  enough compute capacity to continue to serve your traffic in the event of the loss of an entire zone (for single-\n  region instances) or an entire region (for multi-region instances). -\n  https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/cpu-utilization In addition, answer A leaves out the details. How would\n  you create a cron job? Using a VM? Cloud Scheduler? And how would you review metrics? What metrics,\n  exactly? I think the ambiguity in A, plus the fact that it uses an inefficient scheduled polling, verses a reactive\n  and efficient serverless alert system, points to D being the best choice",

Choosing a region and zone is important for several reasons: Handling failures\n\fDistribute your resources across multiple zones and regions to tolerate outages. Google designs zones to be\nindependent from each other: a zone usually has power, cooling, networking, and control planes that are\nisolated from other zones, and most single failure events will affect only a single zone. Thus, if a zone\nbecomes unavailable, you can transfer traffic to another zone in the same region to keep your services\nrunning. Similarly, if a region experiences any disturbances, you should have backup services running in a\ndifferent region.
